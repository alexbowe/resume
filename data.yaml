summary :
    - Academic with **eight months industry experience**, including games (**AI**
      and **physics**) and **web database applications**.
    - Three years tutoring and leading teams of tutors underneath me.
    - Achieved **highest award** for every subject at uni, and the **highest honours
      thesis score** in my year. Focused on **Information Retrieval**
      and **Mathematics**.
    - Seeking **research and development** position with focus on
      **advanced algorithms** and **Machine Learning**.


degrees :
    - award : First Class Honours in Computer Science (**Information Retrieval**)
      uni   : Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
      year  : 2010
      gpa   : 4.0

    - award : Bachelor of Computer Science (**Computational Mathematics**) with Distinction
      uni   : Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
      year  : 2009
      gpa   : 4.0


highlights :
    - Wrote my honours thesis on **Multiary Wavelet Trees in Practice** - a
      **compressed text index** never previously implemented or analysed
      empirically, but used frequently as a theoretical device in proofs.
      Discovered an entirely new data structure in the process.
    - Used **Hadoop** and **NLTK** to implement an automatic, **distributed
      keyphrase extractor**.
    - Implemented and profiled a small Database Management System, external
      merge-sort, and sort-merge join in C.
    - Implemented a **lexer** and **parser** for a toy language using Flex and 
      Bison.
    - Researched and wrote an essay about the origins, rationale and
      practicality of **Erlang**.
    - Wrote an essay describing the Chomsky Hierarchy, types of **automota**, 
      **decidability**, and **P vs NP**.
    - Lead small teams for two software projects, using **Scrum** and **XP**.

      summary : Worked on the game **Puzzle Quest 2**. I established a framework 
                for particle systems using Lua, easing the creation of complicated 
                effects, and created a tool in C# to define and visualise cubic 
                splines. Prior to this, paths were specified numerically, and 
                there was no way of seeing it until the game was compiled and running.
                This enabled the job to be done by the **artists rather than the programmers**,
                and much more rapidly. I also redesigned a memory-efficient, incremental A* 
                search in C++, which **reduced memory use by approximately 89%** on 
                the Nintendo DS.

      summary : During my studies I held the position of **head tutor** for Computing Theory
                and Professional Computing Practice. My duties included **delegating tasks** among
                other tutors, organising class material, and maintaining student marks.
                I also delivered material as a tutor for several other subjects,
                including Operating Systems, Assembly, and Software Engineering.
                This contributed to my **leadership skills**, **clarity of explanation**,
                and confidence in **public speaking**.

    - company : Serraview
      start   : October 2010
      end     : November 2010
      summary : Wrote **automated component and unit tests** for a web application.
                These were guided by the requirements document, and I was required
                to document when and why some requirements were not testable. I furthered this
                by proposing solutions to some of the problems. This gave
                me experience with **technical documentation**.

    - company : Infomedia
      start   : October 2009
      end     : February 2010
      summary : Worked on a web database application in Adobe Flex, with a PHP and MySQL
                backend, utilising an MVC framework. Here I **initiated the use of a unit
                testing framework**.
