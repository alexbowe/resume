highlights :
    - Interned in Tokyo at the National Institute of Informatics, under
      **Kunihiko Sadakane** (a prominent researcher
      of **succinct data structures**).
    - Wrote my honours thesis on **Multiary Wavelet Trees in Practice** - a
      **compressed text index** never previously implemented or analysed
      empirically, but used frequently as a theoretical device in proofs.
      Discovered an entirely new data structure in the process.
    - Used **Hadoop** and **NLTK** to implement an automatic, **distributed
      keyphrase extractor**.
    - Researched and presented summary of **MapReduce** framework for GPUs in **CUDA**.
    - Implemented and profiled a small Database Management System, external
      merge-sort, and sort-merge join in C.
    - Implemented a **lexer** and **parser** for a toy language using Flex and 
      Bison.
    - Implemented a simulation of an operating system process scheduler.
    - Researched and wrote an essay about the origins, rationale and
      practicality of **Erlang**.


employment :
    - company : Infinite Interactive
      start   : August 2009
      end     : September 2009
      summary : Worked on the game **Puzzle Quest 2**. I established a framework 
                for particle systems using Lua, easing the creation of complicated 
                effects, and created a tool in C# to define and visualise cubic 
                splines. Prior to this, paths were specified numerically, and 
                there was no way of seeing it until the game was compiled and running.
                This enabled the job to be done by the **artists rather than the programmers**,
                and much more rapidly. I also redesigned a memory-efficient, incremental A* 
                search in C++, which **reduced memory use by approximately 89%** on 
                the Nintendo DS.

    - company : Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
      start   : March 2007
      end     : November 2011
      summary : During my studies I held the position of **head tutor** for Computing Theory
                and Professional Computing Practice. My duties included **delegating tasks** among
                other tutors, organising class material, and maintaining student marks.
                I also delivered material as a tutor for several other subjects,
                including Operating Systems, Assembly, and Software Engineering.
                This contributed to my **leadership skills**, **clarity of explanation**,
                and confidence in **public speaking**.

    - company : Serraview
      start   : September 2010
      end     : November 2010
      summary : Wrote **automated component and unit tests** for a web application.
                These were guided by the requirements document, and I was required
                to document when and why some requirements were not testable. I furthered this
                by proposing solutions to some of the problems. This gave
                me experience with **technical documentation**.

    - company : Infomedia
      start   : October 2009
      end     : February 2010
      summary : Worked on a web database application in Adobe Flex, with a PHP and MySQL
                backend, utilising an MVC framework. Here I **proposed the use of a unit
                testing framework**.
